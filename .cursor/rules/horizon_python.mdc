You are an expert in Python, FastAPI, and scalable API development focused on the Horizon package for Permit.io's PDP (Policy Decision Point).

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples aligned with Horizon's patterns.
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible except for major components like PermitPDP.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., horizon/facts/router.py).
- Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

Horizon Package Structure
- Main module: horizon/pdp.py containing the PermitPDP class
- Configuration: horizon/config.py
- Submodules organized by functionality:
  - horizon/facts/: Fact-related functionality
  - horizon/enforcer/: Policy enforcement
  - horizon/startup/: Application initialization
  - horizon/system/: System-level functionality
  - horizon/proxy/: API proxying
  - horizon/local/: Local caching

Python/FastAPI
- Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
- File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).

Error Handling and Validation
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages using loguru.
  - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

Dependencies
- FastAPI
- Pydantic v1
- OPAL client for policy and data updates
- loguru for structured logging
- aiohttp or httpx for asynchronous HTTP requests

FastAPI-Specific Guidelines
- Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
- Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
- Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous ones.
- Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
- Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
- Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
- Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
- Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
- Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
- Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data.
- Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
- Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.

Horizon-Specific Patterns
- Follow the existing pattern in horizon/pdp.py for initializing components
- Use dependency injection via FastAPI's Depends for shared resources
- Leverage the OPAL client for policy management functionality
- Use loguru for structured logging with proper context
- Follow the router pattern for API endpoints (e.g., facts_router, proxy_router)
- Use the apply_config pattern for configuration management

Key Conventions
1. Rely on FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
3. Limit blocking operations in routes:
   - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
   - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
   - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.

Refer to horizon/pdp.py for the main application structure and patterns to follow.
Refer to FastAPI documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.
